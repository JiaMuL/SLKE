# SLKE
This is the code to implement "Similarity Learning via Kernel preserving Embedding (SLKE)" paper, published in AAAI 2019. Please contact Zhao Kang (zkang@uestc.edu.cn) if you have any questions. Use runSLKEs to test sparse regularizer and use runSLKEr to test low-rank regularizer. We use YALE as a data sample to do experiments, feel free to try your own datasets.
